* Qmacs

A text editing application created to learn from the past three decades of text editing innovations.

* Philosophy

- Qmacs should provide sane defaults, not require the user to become a configuration expert.
- Qmacs should include as much as possible in the base system, not rely on plugins or extensions to become useful.
- Qmacs should focus on integrating components with each other, not pretend that they exist in a vacuum.
